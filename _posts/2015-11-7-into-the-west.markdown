#Into the west 

###Singer:Annie Lennox

歇息吧,赶走你一身的疲惫

Lay down your sweet and weary head.

夜晚降临,你的旅程终于结束

Night is falling,you've come to journey's end.

安睡吧,做梦吧,让你以前做过的梦

Sleep now and dream of the ones who came before

越过遥远的海岸向你召唤

They are calling from across the distant shore.

你为何哭泣？你的脸上为什么流下晶莹泪珠？

Why do you weep?What are these tears upon your face?

你很快就会看到你所有的恐惧将消失

Soon you will see all of your fears will pass away.

安静地躺在我怀里安然入睡

Safe in my arms.You're only sleeping.

你在地平线上看到什么?

What can you see on the horizon?

白色的海鸥为什么召唤

Why do the white gulls call?

洁白的月亮从海面升起

Across the sea a pale moon rises.

远方的帆船将载你回家

The ships have come to carry you home.

一切都会变成银白透明

And all will turn to silver glass.

海上出现一道光芒

A light on the water.

生命终将结束人们也会失去希望

All souls pass.Hope fades

消失在漆黑的夜晚

Into the world of night.

黑暗将笼罩大地,记忆与时间已不重要

Through shadows falling out of memory and time.

别说话，我们终将走到尽头

Don't say，We have come now to the end

洁白的海岸枕在眼前,你和我将再见面

White shores are calling.You and I will meet again.

你将躺在我的怀里安然入睡

And you'll be here in my arms just sleeping.

你在地平线上看到什么？

What can you see on the horizon?   

白色的海鸥为什么召唤？

Why do the white gulls call?

洁白的月亮从海面升起

Across the sea a pale moon rises.

远方的帆船将载你回家

The ships have come to carry you home.

一切都会变成银白透明

And all will turn to silver glass.

海上出现一道光芒

A light on the water.

灰色帆船驶过消失在西方...

Grey ships pass into the West...
